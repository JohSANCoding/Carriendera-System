### Carriendera System

This is a Carriendera System.

The main feature of this system is that it is meant to be a comprehensive storage of all the local eateries in a designate 'Central Area'
Pending features are as follows:
- A scrollable list of preset eateries (Will be periodically updated
- Potential map feature to directly pin point the location for better guidance
- General overview of the location as well as some aspects that influence eating experience
  - A menu of the meals provided generally
  - General sanitation/ambience/service of the location
  - Each eatery having a unique ID tied to them.
- A reivew/notes system that stores information made by the user
- Will use JSON to handle file management and import/export.=
- Mostly local for now, with additional eateries added by the user available only to them

Current Priorities
 - [ ] Handle the file management through JSON with C++
 - [ ] Make barebones GUI (Not yet interacting with the JSON files)
